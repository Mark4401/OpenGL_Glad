# Welcome to my OpenGL and GLFW Project :)

I'm an new Dev with a bit of experience with C++.Well beginner/indeterminate level of Knowledge regarding coding wise.
for now I don't have anything major planned but a few things i would like build would be:
- an GUI library like IMgui
- 2nd game then later going to 3d.
- maybe even trying vulkan but thats for future me.

When it comes to IamGui i really love the way it functions but i despise its ui blocky and bland look as long with its fell. IDK personal preference.
Yes I know my cmake syntax and stranded coding practices aren't the top senior level but it works for me. 
I might try and learn more and further improve on cmake but for know I'm focused with learning more in c++, GLAD, OPENGL, and GLFW.
If you have any tips please share them I will need them :sweat_smile:. 

Well thats it for me.
